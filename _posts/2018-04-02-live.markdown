This blog is based Jekyll + Github pages. This is my first time really using both, so things may work a little.. cludgy.. to begin with. 

I've managed to edit the cayman CSS theme and add a few little things - the buttons are not yet dynamic but I'm looking at a way of parsing the SIA Mining API and then using the json output to update that on a regular interval. Other stuff to do is re-do the way the blog is laid out and look at some different plugins. 

Still waiting for my Halong B52 to turn up :(
