Today I got around to revisiting a little project I started a while back - I can now display the hashrate from my siamining.com worker stats via their API on an Adafruit LCD screen. 

I'll do a proper write up at some point & add a video/photos. 

Code for the script below:

```python

import Adafruit_CharLCD as LCD
import urllib2
import json
import time
lcd = LCD.Adafruit_CharLCDPlate()
url = "https://siamining.com/api/v1/addresses/../workers"

try:
        while True:
                workers = json.load(urllib2.urlopen(url))
                hr0 = (workers[0]["intervals"][0]["hash_rate"])
                hr1 = (workers[1]["intervals"][0]["hash_rate"])
                result0 = float(hr0) / 1000000000
                result1 = float(hr1) / 1000000000
                result = result0 + result1
                total = result / 1000
                lcd.message(" %.2f" % float(total) + ' TH/s')
                time.sleep(30)
                lcd.clear()

except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Cleaning up!")
        lcd.clear()
```

I'm pretty sure I can do the conversion stuff a little cleaner, but it works for now. Next step is to integrate this with an Alexa skill.
