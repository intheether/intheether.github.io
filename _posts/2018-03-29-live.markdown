Hello and welcome!

This site has been tracked to follow and record my journey in the rocky world of Crypto Mining; starting off at a very small scale in the hope of turning this into a 'proper' operation.

You will find information on my rigs, how I network them (and posts on Networking in general), how I maintain and monitor them and the struggle with HMRC and tax ;-)
